question 1: Reflex Agent
	for this question, i took help from the class lecture mostly, but tried to understad the logic
        behind the code. I tried to make sure about the behavior of the pacman within various conditions,
        when integrating food pallets, adding ghosts, adding in the scared times for pacman to ear the ghost and 
        other properties which help make the evaluation function better.

Question 2: Minimax
       this Question was also based on the class lecture, which calculates the best action in the given depth
       of the pacman and the ghost. on this implementation the ghost stops at random position and when the ghost
       comes around it runs away, i didnt see the pacman wining for most of the parts
